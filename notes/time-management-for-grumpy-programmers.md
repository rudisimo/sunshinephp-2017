# Time Management For Grumpy Programmers
> Chris Hartjes

### Notes

* Don't lie to yourself!
* Put everything in the calendar (even the daily minutiae).
* Schedule time blocks to work on tasks.
* Using your calendar will show you what is getting done.
* Taking control of your time is the best thing you can do for your career and mental health.
* Do fewer things, but do them better.
* Doing less work and concentrating better leads to better outcomes.

### 4-Day Work Week Hack

* Interview and get a job offer with a 20% raise
* Tell employer "I want to stay, but only work 4 days a week for the same money"
* Either you get an extra day of extra money

> "You can make more money, but you can't make more time."
